        Look at them. They come to this place when they know they are not pure.
        </p>
        <p>
        Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was cut in half, destroyed, but through its Janus key, the Void called to me. It brought me here, and here I was reborn.
        </p>
        <p>
        We cannot blame these creatures. They are being led by a false prophet, an imposter, who knows not the secrets of the Void.
        </p>
        <p>
        Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm.
        </p>
        <p>
        My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesise this moment?
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus key. Forever bound to the Void.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.
        </p>
